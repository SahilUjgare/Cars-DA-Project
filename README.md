# 🚗 Car Price Dataset Analysis Project

## 📌 Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing a **Car Price Dataset** to uncover insights about the factors that influence car pricing in the resale market. The dataset contains details such as **Brand, Model, Year, Engine Size, Fuel Type, Transmission, Mileage, Doors, Ownership History, and Price**.

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, visualizations, and statistical summaries, this project highlights key relationships between car features and their prices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explore and understand the dataset structure.
* Identify **popular brands and models** and their impact on pricing.
* Study the influence of **year, mileage, ownership count, and engine size** on resale value.
* Compare **fuel types and transmission systems** with respect to pricing and mileage.
* Formulate **25 data analysis questions** to guide exploration.
* Generate **visualizations and insights** to support findings.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of **10,000 rows and 10 columns**:

* **Brand** – Car manufacturer
* **Model** – Car model
* **Year** – Year of manufacture
* **Engine\_Size** – Engine capacity (in liters)
* **Fuel\_Type** – Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric
* **Transmission** – Manual, Automatic, Semi-Automatic
* **Mileage** – Distance covered (in km)
* **Doors** – Number of doors
* **Owner\_Count** – Number of previous owners
* **Price** – Price of the car

---

## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Loading and cleaning the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** –

   * Distribution of car prices
   * Popular brands & models
   * Average price by fuel type & transmission
   * Price vs. Mileage analysis
   * Impact of ownership and year on prices
3. **Data Analysis Questions (25)** – Designed to guide exploration.
4. **Visualization** – Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and boxplots.
5. **Conclusion** – Key findings about car pricing factors.

## 🔑 Key Insights

* Luxury brands (Mercedes, Audi, BMW) have **higher average prices**, while budget brands (Kia, Chevrolet, Hyundai) are more affordable.
* Newer cars (after 2020) retain **higher values**, while older cars depreciate faster.
* **Electric cars** are fewer but generally priced higher than petrol/diesel cars.
* **Mileage negatively correlates with price** – higher mileage reduces value.
* Cars with more owners tend to have **lower resale prices**.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Build a **Machine Learning Model** to predict car prices.
* Perform **time-series trend analysis** on yearly car data.
* Expand analysis with **external datasets** (insurance, region, fuel cost, etc.).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations
* **ReportLab** – PDF report generation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment
